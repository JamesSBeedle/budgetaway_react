        <h4>Our Story</h4>
        <p>Welcome to Budgetaway, the holiday planning and budgeting app which makes turning your dream holiday into reality. Created by <em>Quantum Waft</em>, we realised the frustration of trawling through holiday sites trying to decide where to go mixed with discovering lots of hidden costs, dampened the excitement of booking your next holiday. Therefore we sought to bring back that excitement!</p>
        <p>  
        Not sure where to go? No problem! Simply select any country to find out more about it, search for flights and estimate costs. Or use the handy filters to narrow down your search if you have an idea of where you want to explore next.</p>
        <p>Once you've settled on your destination and flights, add it to your wishlist and then enter a few details to help you figure out a monthly savings plan that fits your budget.</p>
